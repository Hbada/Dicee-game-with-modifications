# Dicee-game-with-modifications
The Dicee game was created in an online class at udemy.com, by Angela Yu, and modified with new font and colour palette.
The project occurs early in the course, just after introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CSS and HTML were provided while the student adds JavaScript to make the dice roll randomly and display the correct image.
